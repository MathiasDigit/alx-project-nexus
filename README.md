# ProDev Program - Backend Development

## üîç Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is an intensive, practice-oriented training course designed to teach how to design and develop robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems.  
This repository contains the code, exercises, and projects completed during the program.

## üöÄ Key Technologies Studied

- **Python**: The main programming language used to develop server-side business logic.
- **Django**: A powerful and fast web framework for building full-featured backend applications.
- **REST APIs**: Building RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.
- **GraphQL**: A modern query language for efficiently querying nested data.
- **Docker**: Application containerization to ensure portability and consistency across environments.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Deployment using tools like GitHub Actions.

## üìö In-Depth Backend Concepts

- **Database Modeling**: Relational design, normalization, and use of ER diagrams (ERDs).
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Using `async/await` to improve performance in certain Django views.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing caching via Redis or Django's built-in cache system to improve response times.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

### Challenge 1: Heavy Queries in REST APIs
- **Solution**: Added pagination and optimized queries using `select_related` and `only()`.

### Challenge 2: Containerizing a Complex Django Project
- **Solution**: Used `docker-compose` to separate services (web, database, cache).

### Challenge 3: Circular Import Issues in Django
- **Solution**: Refactored files and used `apps.get_model()` to dynamically reference models.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Key Takeaways

- Use **environment variables** for configuration (secrets, keys, etc.).
- Write **modular and testable code** (unit tests, integration tests).
- Document APIs using **Swagger or Postman**.
- Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** early in the project.
- Always **optimize database queries** to ensure performance.
